# So you want to contribute, thats great!
Here are a few things you should know.

### Style
Please try and keep to the established style. I like my tabs to be 4 spaces and there is nothing you can do about it.
That being said, if you thing something looks like spaghetti and you want to fix it, go for it.

### Testing
Seeing as one can't send themselves a notification, it can be hard to test your code. You should still try to test it though.
Ask for people to ping you in the powercord server, use an alt, figure something out. If you need help testing, I am happy
to ping you our send you a dm or whatever, just let me know. Also, **tell me how and what you tested**. In the PR template,
there is a section called **Testing methods**. Fill it out. I need to know what you tested so I can replicate your results
and test what you didn't.

### Pull Requests
1. Only submit PR's to the dev branch
2. Use the PR template

Do those, and I am happy to work with you to get your PR merged.
